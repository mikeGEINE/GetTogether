The main idea of "Get Together" is to allow users find companions for any kind of activities and make new friends. 

It's always more interesting to do something being not alone, but our friends can't join us any time we need it. That's why this app is so relevant for modern people: share your plans with everyone and find new partners!

To run this application you need to:
* Clone the repo

* In the command line run 'rails db:migrate'

* Run 'rails s' to start the app on the localhost

Enjoy!!!
